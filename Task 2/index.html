    <h1>Petra</h1>
    <p>The area around Petra has been inhabited from as early as 7000 BC,[7] and the Nabataeans might have settled in what would become the capital city of their kingdom as early as the 4th century BC.[8] Archaeological work has only discovered evidence of Nabataean presence dating back to the second century BC,[9] by which time Petra had become their capital.</p>
